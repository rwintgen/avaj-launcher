# AVAJ Launcher

A small airport logistics simulation used to analyze runway bottlenecks at Frankfurt
airport. Scenarios with different weather and traffic conditions are simulated so the
team can identify which situations cause the worst congestion and where to focus
improvements.

## Project overview

The chief designer produced a high-level design and asked the development team to
implement a simulator in Java. The simulator should be extensible and follow classic
object-oriented practices and design patterns so it can be adapted to future needs.

### Provided by the architect

- A UML class diagram describing the initial domain model
- A set of required Object-Oriented design patterns to incorporate (see below)

### Goals

- Simulate multiple scenarios (weather, traffic, runway availability)
- Provide a clear model using design patterns for maintainability and extensibility
- Produce output that helps detect and analyze runway bottlenecks

## Required knowledge

- Reading and interpreting UML class diagrams (the architect's primary communication)
- Java and its core syntax/features
- The following design patterns: Observer, Singleton, Factory

These patterns are used to make the simulator modular and easy to extend.
